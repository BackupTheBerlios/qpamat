    This file contains some constants for the cryptographic algorithms used in this program.

/*!
    \def HASH_ALGORITHM

    The hash algorithm used in this program. See also "Abenteuer Kryptologie", page 292
    for a detailed description of the security of such algorithms. According to
    this book and according to my interpretion this is the best one. If you change
    this the password could not be read by a "normal" compiled program, so be careful.
 */

/*!
    \def KEY_CREATION_COUNT

    A higher count makes the algorithm more secure but is slower.
    See http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html.
