/**
 * Class for handling memory cards. 
 * 
 * Here's some background information about programming with smartcards etc.
 * The information which was used to program this class is from following sources:
 *
 *  - Manual pages ctapi(3) and ctbcs(3) from the Towitoko CT-API driver at 
 *    http://www.geocities.com/cprados/ .
 *  - Official CT-API specification at http://www.panstruga.de/ct-api/spec/spec_v09.html .
 *  - c't (very good German computer magazine) article "Kartenspiele", "Grundlagen der
 *    Chipkartenprogrammierung", Kai-Uwe Mrkor, c't 8/2000, page 208.
 * 
 * A very good overview about the different APIs for programming with chipcards was in the
 * article "Karten-Spiele", "Smartcard-Programmierung unter Linux", Frank Haubenschild in
 * the German magazine "Linux-Magazin" 06/2002 which is also available online at
 * http://www.linux-magazin.de/Artikel/ausgabe/2002/06/smartcards/smartcards.html. I choosed
 * the CT-API because there was a driver available for my reader, this API is wide-spread in
 * Germany, it's available on both *nix and Windows and my homebanking programme Moneyplex
 * from Matrica also uses this API and chipcard communication works well. 
 *
 * There's no need to start a server on machine and the user only has to specify one library.
 * You don't need root permissions if you have access to the serial port, of course.
