QPaMaT -- password managing tool
================================


You find the documentation in the doc/user/en/manual subdirectory in HTML
format. Just start your favourite web browser and read this manual. It contains
also installation instruction. For licensing issues read COPYING.

There's no version for MS Windows now, but Qt 4.0 will be available in terms
of GNU GPL, so I think I'm able to port it.

If you encounter any problems and if you've read the manual, feel free to
contact me via e-mail (bernhard.walle@gmx.de) or Jabber (bwalle@jabber.ccc.de)
if I have time.
