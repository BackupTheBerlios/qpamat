QPaMaT -- password managing tool
================================


You find the documentation in the doc/user/en/manual subdirectory in HTML
format. Just start your favourite web browser and read this manual. It contains
also installation instruction. For licensing issues read COPYING.

If you encounter any problems and if you've read the manual, feel free to
contact me via e-mail (bernhard.walle@gmx.de) or Jabber (bwalle@jabber.ccc.de)
if I have time.

To build it on Unix, use:

 $ qmake qpamat.pro
 $ make

To build it on Windows using MS Visual Studio .NET 2003, start a Visual Studio .NET
command prompt (it's available in the start menu), change in the qpamat directory and
type

 $ qmake qpamat.pro
 $ nmake

Of course, you have to have installed Qt, for example from
http://kde-cygwin.sourceforge.net/qt3-win32/compile-net.php.
